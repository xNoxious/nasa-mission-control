# This is the Dockerfile before we add layers for optimizing what gets run
# Choose basic image - alpine is a very lightweight linux flavour
FROM node:lts-alpine

# Specify a working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy project folder to /app
COPY . .

# --only=production: install packages without dev dependencies
RUN npm install --only=production 

# --prefix client is a command from our own package.json
RUN npm run build --prefix client

# Run the image via a specific user, otherwise it would use root
USER node

# Because of this command in the client app:
# "build": "BUILD_PATH=../server/public react-scripts build",
# we store a build version on the client side so no need to start client (check app.js) 
# CMD: gives instructions on what to run when the container starts
CMD ["npm", "start", "--prefix", "server"]

# Choose what port to expose
EXPOSE 8000
